# 🌍 AI-Powered Financial Inclusion Platform  
**Prototype**

> Empowering rural women in India with AI-driven financial advice, transparent group management, and inclusive access via mobile, SMS, and voice.

---

## ✨ Problem
- Millions of rural women remain **outside mainstream financial tools**.  
- **Barriers**: limited smartphone access, low financial literacy, lack of personalized guidance.  
- Existing fintech apps focus on urban users, leaving **Self-Help Groups (Bachatgats)** underserved.

---

## 💡 Solution
A **multi-channel financial advisor** that works for *everyone*:  

- 📱 **Smartphone users** → mobile/web app for savings, loans, and investment tracking.  
- 📩 **Feature phone users** → SMS reminders + 2-way responses (deposit, loan dues, meetings).  
- ☎️ **Low-literacy users** → IVR/voice support (future scope).  
- 🧠 **AI Advisor** → personalized tips & group-level investment suggestions.  
- 📊 **Transparency Reports** → builds trust in SHGs and households.  
- 🎓 **Financial Literacy Nudges** → small, contextual education bites.  

---

## 🎯 Pilot Use Case: SHGs (Bachatgats)
While the platform addresses **financial inclusion broadly**, we demonstrate it in the context of **women’s Self-Help Groups**:  
- Automated SMS deposit confirmations  
- Group balance & loan repayment tracking  
- Collective savings insights (e.g., “Your group can invest in XYZ scheme”)  

This makes our demo concrete **while remaining scalable** to individuals and urban users.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Frontend**: React (PWA)  
- **AI Engine**: Rule-based logic + ML heuristics (Python)  
- **Database**: SQLite (demo)  
- **SMS/IVR**: Twilio sandbox (simulated for prototype)
